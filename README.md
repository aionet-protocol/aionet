# AIONET Protocol

**AI-Governed | DRAM-Mined | Trustless Ledger**

AIONET is a next-generation Layer 1 blockchain protocol that fuses:
- **AI validation agents** (Python)
- **DRAM-based consensus simulations** (Rust)
- **Autonomous smart contract governance**
- **Cross-chain tollway bridge** (Layer 2)
- **zk-SNARK + biometric authentication layer** (Layer 3)

### 🌐 Mission
To redefine trust and transaction verification by blending AI cognition with high-speed memory logic, pushing the blockchain paradigm toward intelligent decentralization.
