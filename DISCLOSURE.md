AIONET Protocol ‚Äì Intellectual Property Disclosure Statement
Public Disclosure Date: July 27, 2025
Filed by: [Placeholder: AIONET Labs LLC ‚Äì Pending Registration]

üß† Project Summary
AIONET is a next-generation Layer 1 blockchain protocol that fuses AI validation agents, DRAM-mined consensus, autonomous governance, cross-chain tollway bridges, and biometric zk-authentication into a modular 8-layer trustless system. The architecture emphasizes intelligent decentralization through real-time memory-based validation and reasoning-driven smart contract execution.

üîê Protected Elements
Protected Item	Description
DRAM-Mined Consensus Protocol	Uses high-speed memory (DRAM) as the primary resource for achieving consensus, incentivizing compute over energy or stake
AI Validator-Agent Framework	Agents powered by Python (LangChain future integration) for transaction scoring, fraud detection, and adaptive rule validation
Layered Architecture (L1‚ÄìL8)	Modular system including private layers not yet released (Layers 4‚Äì8), governing compute liquidity, identity shielding, governance, and network self-adjustment
Cross-Chain Tollway Bridge	Layer 2 bridge integrating Solidity-based smart contracts for fee-driven liquidity transfer
zk + Biometric Identity Layer	Combines zk-SNARKs with biometric verification for Layer 3 privacy and access control
Memory-Weighted Rewards Logic	Proof-of-access/timing/entropy models tied to RAM usage rather than token stake or GPU hash
