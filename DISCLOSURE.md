# AIONET Protocol ‚Äì Intellectual Property Disclosure Statement

**Public Disclosure Date:** July 27, 2025  
**Filed by:** *[Placeholder: AIONET Labs LLC ‚Äì Pending Registration]*

## üß† Project Summary

**AIONET** is a next-generation Layer 1 blockchain protocol that fuses AI validation agents, DRAM-mined consensus, autonomous governance, cross-chain tollway bridges, and biometric zk-authentication into a modular 8-layer trustless system. The architecture emphasizes intelligent decentralization through real-time memory-based validation and reasoning-driven smart contract execution.

## üîê Protected Elements

| **Protected Element**            | **Description** |
|----------------------------------|------------------|
| **DRAM-Mined Consensus Protocol** | Uses high-speed DRAM as the primary resource for achieving consensus, incentivizing compute over energy or stake |
| **AI Validator-Agent Framework**  | Python-based agents (LangChain integration planned) for transaction scoring, fraud detection, and adaptive logic |
| **Layered Architecture (L1‚ÄìL8)**  | Modular structure with unreleased private layers (4‚Äì8) governing compute liquidity, governance, and identity shielding |
| **Cross-Chain Tollway Bridge**    | Layer 2 Solidity-based system for fee-driven, permissioned liquidity transfer |
| **zk + Biometric Identity Layer** | Layer 3 privacy layer combining zk-SNARKs with biometric user verification |
| **Memory-Weighted Rewards Logic** | Validator rewards based on RAM timing/access/entropy ‚Äî not token staking or GPU hashing |
