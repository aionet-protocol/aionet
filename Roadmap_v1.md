# AIONET Protocol — Roadmap_v1

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-03

Welcome to the AIONET Protocol development roadmap. This high-level outline offers visibility into the phased development of our AI-governed, memory-validated blockchain architecture. It does not disclose implementation specifics but serves as a directional blueprint.

---

## 🧬 Phase 1: Core Protocol Foundation
- [x] Design Layer 1–4 (PoM, AI Tollgate, Entropy Ledger, PoD)
- [x] Launch AIONET GitHub repository (Public)
- [ ] Finalize validator testnet model (Q3 2025)
- [ ] Publish Layer 1 protocol spec (internal draft)
- [ ] Whitepaper Draft v1.0 (Scientific Vault)

## 🔗 Phase 2: Interoperability & Toll Layer Buildout
- [ ] Design Layer 5–7 (ZK, Bridge, External API Gate)
- [ ] Build zk-SNARK compression module (WIP)
- [ ] Dev prototype for Cross-Chain Tollgate (target: EVM bridge)

## 🧠 Phase 3: Memory Drift & Cold-State Logic
- [ ] Model PoD temporal decay using calculus (dV/dt)
- [ ] Develop AI scoring engine for behavioral entropy
- [ ] Design Layer 8–9 (Offline Ledger, Recovery Layer)

## 🛰️ Phase 4: Strategic & Sovereign Layers (Private)
- [ ] Finalize Layer 10: Sovereign Autonomy Systems
- [ ] Define Layer 11: Quantum Integration / Biometric Trust

## 🧪 Exploratory Threads
- Memory fingerprinting under voltage/temp stress
- DRAM/HBM decay modeling for entropy curve validation
- Forecast model adaptation (mechanical, weather, economic)
